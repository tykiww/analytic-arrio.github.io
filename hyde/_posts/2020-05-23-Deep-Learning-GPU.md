Here are some tutorials. Please don't really prioritize this in your work. This should be learned really, only when necessary. If you want more exposure to Deep Learning, hop on a project with me after you're complete with yours.

### Tutorials:

- [Deep Learning 1](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification)

- [Deep Learning 2](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-for-beginners-practical-guide-with-python-and-keras-d295bfca4487)

- [Deep Learning 3](https://missinglink.ai/guides/computer-vision/complete-guide-deep-learning-gpus)

- Optional History (Very intersting)

Other Notes:
1) GPU cards were first used in Stanford's computer science department in 2009 and are now widely used to power large-scale neural network projects around the globe, revolutionizing the Deep Learning industry. A deep learning algorithm's accuracy has become less dependent on mathematical model structure and more reliant on computation. The higher the computational speed, the less time a model needs to reach and optimal solution.
