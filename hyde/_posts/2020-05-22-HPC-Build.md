# HPC Basics

Obviously, we aren't experts. However, we can get the gist of it to build ourselves.

Unfortunatly, only part 1 exists. But here is one video

If you were curious about HPC, Oakridge, just on the other side of town, has the largest supercomputer in the world. Click [here](https://www.wired.com/story/worlds-fastest-supercomputer-breaks-ai-record/) for a quick read.

Also, [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BBDxzJL6fY) does a tremendous job to explain, in a high level, networking and HPC. Kind of boring, but highly encouraged to watch.

On another note, [this link](http://on-demand.gputechconf.com/gtc/2014/presentations/S4253-tools-tips-for-managing-a-gpu-cluster.pdf) is a powerpoint from the NVIDIA conference. This is followed by the [subsequent instructions](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/how-build-gpu-accelerated-research-cluster/) on how to build an GPU Accelerated HPC. Although we may not use this particular method, this may give you a better sense for how GPUs play a part in the bigger picture.
