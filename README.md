# My Project Page.


Alright dude. Here it is.

These are the instructions for how you can make this yours. Yours and yours only.


Right now, the page url is: https://tykiww.github.io/analytic-arrio.github.io

1. Go to the top right-hand corner and click "Fork"
2. Go to Settings, and on the header titled "Github Pages" click on the dropdown under source and select Master Branch.
  - This will load your page. If you get a green banner that says `Your site is published at https://analytic-arrio.github.io/` after refreshing your page 5-6 times, you are good to go! This step may take a while so be patient.
  - Now you can go to `https://analytic-arrio.github.io/` and view what you have so far.
2. Locate the `_config.yml` file and follow the instructions in the `#` sections that contain `TYKI:` 
  - You are also welcome to make any other changes. Just don't ruin the style guide (format) and you should be good.
3. Go to the docs folder and it should give you instructions on how to navigate everything.
4. Under the folders `hyde/` and `hydejack/` you will see some example blog posts. You can just delete these, but they have good tips on how to write up blogs on markdown.


Sorry it's such a vague intro but the whole point is, you gotta mess around with it and get used to it on your own!

Best of luck!
